# Quick overview

## What is Loomio?

Loomio is a simple, user-friendly online tool for collaborative decision-making. Loomio lets you host discussions online, invite the right people to participate, come to timely decisions and transform deliberation into real-world action.

## How Loomio works

* **[Start a group](https://www.loomio.org/help#starting-new-group)** to collaborate with people on Loomio

* **[Invite people](https://www.loomio.org/help#inviting-members)** into your group

* **[Start a discussion](https://www.loomio.org/help#starting-discussions)** on any topic

* **[Make a proposal](https://www.loomio.org/help#starting-proposals)** to see how everyone feels about a particular course of action

* **[Decide together](https://www.loomio.org/help#stating-positions)** - anyone can agree, abstain, disagree, or block – so you can see how everyone feels about the proposal.

Check out the video for a quick demonstration of how to use Loomio.

## Getting started

Your introduction to Loomio might happen in a couple of ways. Here’s some information about each entry point:

### Starting a group from the home page

You can start a new group from the Loomio home page by clicking the **Try out Loomio **button. Enter your name, email address and group name into the [Start a new group](https://www.loomio.org/start_group) form. You will receive an email containing a link that will take you to your new group.

### You are invited into a Loomio group

When you receive an invitation to join an existing Loomio group, you will receive a unique invitation link by email.

If this is your first time using Loomio you will be prompted to create an account. If you already have a Loomio account you will be taken straight to the group after you log in.

### Single sign-on

Loomio allows sign-up with Facebook, Google, Twitter or Persona. If you do not have a Loomio account you can sign up using any of these third-party services by clicking the corresponding button on the [Log in page](http://loomio.org/sign_in). If you are currently logged in to Google, Facebook, Twitter or Persona, we'll link your loomio account to that login method. Otherwise you will be prompted to sign in. When Loomio recognises your existing third-party account, follow the prompts to create your Loomio account.

You may also associate your Google, Facebook, Twitter or Persona account with an existing Loomio account. Ensure you are logged out, visit the [Log in page](https://www.loomio.org/users/sign_in) and select your preferred platform. Loomio will ask you if you want to create a new account with your existing account on your chosen platform, or link it to your existing Loomio account.

# Loomio manual

## Group settings

Group coordinators can edit group settings: **Profile**, **Privacy** and **Permissions**. 

To edit your group settings, open the **Options** menu on the group page and select **Edit Group ****Settings**.

### **Group profile**

Your group profile consists of your group name and group description. 

It’s helpful if the description gives new members a clear understanding of what that group is for. When adding a group description, describe what your group intends to do, for example, *A public group for us to approve requests for use of the gallery space* or *The space for our board members to consider budget proposals*. 

### Group privacy

Your privacy settings determine who can find your group, who can see the threads in your group, and how people join. 

When you start a new group, only you and people you invite will be able to find it, and only you will be able to invite new people.

#### Who can find this group?

If you choose **Anyone**, the group will be publicly searchable. Making your group public makes it easy for people to find your group, without you having to send them a personal invitation. 

If you choose **Members only** the group can only be found by invited members: it will not come up in public search results. You can only have private discussions in a **Members only** group.

#### **How do people join?**

Groups can be **Open** to join, accessible **By request** or **By invitation**.

The **Open** option means anyone with a Loomio account can join the group. A new visitor to your group page will be able to join your group immediately with the **Join group** button. (Note: **Members only **groups cannot be set to **Open**).

The **By request** option means anyone can ask to join the group. A new visitor to your group page will find an **Ask to join group** button. When someone asks to join, the group coordinators will be notified that there is a new membership request. Membership requests can be approved or ignored. (Note: **Members only** groups cannot be set to **By Request**).

If you select **Invitation only**, no-one can join the group without being invited. Invitations are sent from the [Invite people](#heading=h.ljignv2e7gtd) page.

#### Who can see threads?

This configures the default privacy setting for threads in your group. Threads can be **Public** **only**, **Public and private** or **only visible to members.**

**Public threads only** option means the content of all discussions will be visible to people who are not signed in to Loomio. They will still need to join the group to participate. (Note: this option is not applicable to **Members only** groups).

The **Allow public and private threads** option means members of your group can choose whether discussions they start are public or private. (Note: this option is not applicable to **Members only** groups).

If you select **Only visible to members**, all the threads in your group will be private. No one outside of your group will be able to see the content of your discussions.

### Group permissions – what can members do?

Coordinators can set the group permissions to configure what members can do in their group.

#### Invite and approve new members

This allows everyone in your group to invite new people in, and approve any membership requests. When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to invite and approve new members.

#### Create sub-groups

This allows everyone in your group to create subgroups. When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to create subgroups.

#### Start threads

This allows everyone in your group to start new threads. When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to start discussions.

#### Edit the context of any thread in the group

This allows everyone in your group to edit the context of any thread. When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to edit the thread context. (The person who started a thread can always edit the thread context.)

#### Edit their comments at any time

This allows everyone in your group to [edit their comments](https://www.loomio.org/help#editing-comments) at any time. When it is deselected, a comment can only be edited until someone else participates in the thread.

#### Raise proposals

This allows anyone in your group to start a proposal within a thread. When this box is deselected only group coordinators will be able to raise proposals.

#### Vote on proposals

This allows everyone in your group to state their position on proposals. When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to state their position on proposals.

## Coordinating your group

As a coordinator of a Loomio group you’re responsible for guiding your group through the process of learning how to use a new piece of software, as well as learning new processes for collaborating more effectively and making good decisions together. The tasks outlined below are only available to the coordinators of your group.

### Adding a cover photo

When you first arrive in your new Loomio group, there will be a randomly selected cover photo, and a placeholder for your group logo. You can customise how your group looks by adding your own cover photo and logo. You can upload a new cover photo or logo by selecting the upload button (camera icon) in either section. 

### Managing membership

Group coordinators can add and remove members, and grant and remove coordinator permissions. These actions can be performed from the **Members** page, which is accessed via the **Manage Members **link in the **Options **menu on the Group page.

#### Adding/removing coordinators

On the **Members** page, there is a checkbox next to every member. When this checkbox is selected, the member is a coordinator. Deselecting the checkbox removes the coordinator permissions for that member. 

#### Adding/removing group members

On the **Members** page, next to every member there is a **Remove **button ![image alt text](image_0.png). This button removes the member from your group.

#### Accepting/ignoring membership requests

If your [group privacy settings](https://www.loomio.org/help#group-privacy) allow people to join your group **By request**, a coordinator will need to approve each membership request. Group coordinators will receive an email each time there is a new membership request. The link in the notification email will take you to the **Membership requests** page, where you can approve or decline the request.

If there is a pending membership request it will also be visible on your group page in a **Membership requests** panel.

### Deactivating/archiving a group

Deactivating your group means that you and the rest of the group members will no longer be able to access the group. If you wish to deactivate your group you can do so by selecting **Deactivate group** from the **Options** menu on the group page. To reactivate your deactivated group, contact the Loomio team by sending an email to [contact@loomio.org](mailto:contact@loomio.org).

## Inviting new members

Depending on your [group settings](https://www.loomio.org/help#group-settings), new members can be invited either by everyone in the group, or by coordinators only. You’ll find the **Invite people** option on the **Members** panel on your group page, and in the **Action Menu **which can be accessed from anywhere in the app.

You can invite multiple people at once by entering their email addresses into the form, separated by commas. When you submit the invitations form an email will be sent to each of the email addresses you supplied, containing a unique invitation link.

Optionally, you can also choose to add a custom message to the invitation, which can be a great way to engage new members. People will want to know why they’ve been invited, what’s expected of them, and why it’s worth their time to learn how to use a new tool.

### Pending invitations

If there is an outstanding invitation that has not yet been accepted, it will be displayed in the Pending Invitations section of the **Members** page, which is accessed via the **Manage Members **link in the **Options **menu on the group page. You can revoke a pending invitation with the cancel button (the circled-X icon).

## Discussion threads

Discussion threads are where your group can discuss a topic, exchange information and make decisions together.

The thread page is divided into three main sections: 

1. The **Context** panel contains the thread title, context and thread options. 

2. The **Activity **feed contains any updates to the thread. For example, if someone posts a new comment, or starts a new proposal, that activity will show up in this list.

3. The **Proposal **section contains any current or closed proposals for that thread.

### Starting a thread

You can start a new thread from anywhere in the app via the **Action Menu**. There is also a **Start a thread **button on the group page. 

The **Start new thread** form asks for a **Title** and **Context**. The **Title** is a succinct description of the topic being discussed. The **Context** is where you can share any background information your group members need to participate meaningfully in the thread. You can update the **Context **at any time, which can be a useful way to summarise a complex thread.

Loomio uses **Markdown** for text formatting. You can use Markdown in the context panel to format your discussion context, or to embed images. For more information on how to use Markdown, click the **Formatting help** link underneath the comment box at the bottom of the thread page to open [the Markdown guide](http://loomio.org/markdown.). 

### Thread privacy

Thread privacy is configured in the **[Who can see threads**?](#heading=h.ih1sgyxwy4zq) section of your group settings. If your group allows both public and private threads, then when you start a thread, you can choose whether it is public (publicly searchable), or private (only visible to members of your group).

### Editing a thread

**Group members** can edit the title, context and privacy of any thread they have started. **Group coordinators** can edit the title, context and privacy of any threads taking in the group. **Group coordinators** can also determine whether or not group members can edit each others’ threads (see [group settings](https://www.loomio.org/help#group-settings)).

The **Edit thread **option is accessed via the thread options dropdown.

## Comments

### Posting comments

To contribute to a thread, enter your comment into the comment form at the bottom of a thread and click the **Post** button. If Loomio has emailed you a comment, you can also reply directly from your email and your message will appear in the thread.

### Markdown

Loomio uses **Markdown** to let you format text and embed images. For more information on how to use Markdown, click the [Formatting help](https://www.loomio.org/markdown) link under the comment box.

### Attaching files

You can attach files to comments using the attachment button next to the **Post** button on the comment form. You will be prompted to select a file from your device.

### @mentioning group members

If you want to get the attention of a specific person in your group, type **@** into the comment field, followed by their name. As you type, a menu will appear, listing the members in your group that match that name. Select the member you want, then **Post** your comment. They will be notified that you’ve mentioned them in a comment.

### Editing a comment

By default, groups are configured so that a comment can only be edited until someone else contributes a comment to the thread. Group coordinators can also [configure groups to allow users to edit their comments at any time](https://www.loomio.org/help#group-permissions). If you are able to edit your comment, the **Edit comment **option is in the **Comment options** dropdown.

 

### Liking a comment

You can show another member of your group that you appreciate or understand what they’ve said by using the **Like** button below the comment. This will add your name to the list of people who like the comment. You can undo the **Like** action by clicking **Unlike** on the comment.

### Deleting a comment

You can delete your own comments by selecting the **Delete comment** option from the **Comment options** dropdown. Group coordinators can delete any comment in the group.

## Proposals

Proposals take place in a [discussion thread](https://www.loomio.org/help#discussion-threads), which encompasses both the discussion and the proposal. There can only be one active proposal at any time in any thread. 

### Starting a proposal

You can create a new proposal with the **Start proposal** button on the thread page.

When you start a new proposal you will be required to provide a brief **Title**, a **Closing date** and any relevant **Details**. Use the **Details** field to provide any information the group needs so everyone knows exactly what it means to agree or disagree with the proposal.

### Editing a proposal

Only the author of the proposal and the group coordinators can edit proposals. The proposal **title** and **details** can only be edited until the first member participates. However, the **closing time** can be changed at any time. 

To edit the proposal, select the **Edit proposal** option from the proposal options dropdown in the **Proposal** panel.

### Stating your position

When you’re ready participate in a proposal, you can select one of the four decision buttons:

* **Agree** means you’re happy with the proposal.

* **Abstain** means you’re happy for the group to decide without you.

* **Disagree** means you think there might be a better alternative, but you’re willing to go with the group’s decision.

* **Block** means you’ve got serious objections and you’ll be extremely unhappy if this proposal goes ahead.

When you’ve selected your position, you will be prompted to give a brief explanation as to why you feel this way.

Underneath the proposal pie, there will be a list containing the names, positions and position statements of members who have voted on the proposal. You can see what everyone else thinks, making it easy to catch up with the thread. There will also be a **View undecided members** link, which will display a list of the members who have not voted.

### Changing your position

If you wish to change your position you can do so by clicking the** Change your vote **link next to your position in the **Proposal** panel.

### Setting a proposal outcome

When a proposal closes, it collapses into a **Previous proposals** panel. You can expand the proposal by clicking the **Expand **link inside the proposal preview.

 An editable outcome statement field will display underneath the proposal details, and the person who raised the proposal will be prompted via email to provide an outcome statement for their proposal. Proposal outcomes can be set by the person who started the proposal, or by the coordinators of the group. When the proposal outcome statement is set everyone in the group will receive an email notifying them of the outcome.

### Closing a proposal

Only the group member who started the proposal and the coordinators of the group can close an active proposal. To close a proposal, select the **Close proposal** option from the proposal options dropdown. 

### Closed proposals/previous decisions

Closed proposals are reduced to a proposal preview and collapsed into a **Previous proposals** panel. You can expand the proposal by clicking the **Expand **link inside the proposal preview.

## Subgroups

Loomio allows you to create subgroups within your groups. Subgroups let you break your group up into different teams. Loomio subgroups can contain members of the parent group and people who don’t belong to the parent group. Depending on your [group settings](https://www.loomio.org/help#group-settings), subgroups can be created either by everyone in the group, or by coordinators only. To add a subgroup, click the **Add subgroup **link in the **Subgroups** panel on your group page.

### Subgroup privacy

To visit your subgroup settings page, click the **Options** button on the group page and select the **Edit Group Settings** option from the dropdown menu.

Subgroup settings are the same as [group settings](https://www.loomio.org/help#group-settings), but with additional privacy settings.

In the **Privacy **section of the **Edit Group Settings** form, there is a **Who can find this group? **field, which determines whether the subgroup is accessible to members of the parent group. When the **People in [parent group]** option is selected, the subgroup will be listed in the **Subgroups** panel on the parent group page. Members of the parent will also be able to access the subgroup if they navigate to the subgroup’s page.

There is also an additional privacy option relating to the subgroup's discussion privacy.The **Who can see discussions?** field of the **Privacy** section, allows you to choose whether you want discussions to be accessible to members of the parent, or to members of the subgroup only. If you choose to make the subgroup accessible to parent group members, but the discussion threads accessible to members only, then members of the parent will be able to access the subgroup's page, but not access any of the subgroup's threads.

When the **People in [parent group]** option is deselected, only members of the subgroup will be able to find it.

## Recent Threads

**Recent Threads** is the landing page when you sign into Loomio. It gives you an overview of the most recent activity happening in your groups. The **Recent Threads** page displays content from your groups in a prioritised list. Open proposals are at the top, followed by **Starred** threads, then all of the threads from your groups, sorted by most recent activity; **Today**, **Yesterday**,** This month**,** Older than a month**.

If a thread or proposal title is **bold** then new activity has taken place there since you last visited. Numbers in parentheses after titles reflect how many new comments or votes have been posted since you last visited. Proposals will show a pie graph, with your position on the proposal superimposed on the graph. If you haven’t yet stated a position, this will show a question mark. 

### Starred threads

Clicking the star icon on a thread preview marks that thread ‘starred’. Use stars to mark certain threads as important. Only you can see if you’ve starred a thread.

### Filter threads

The **Filter Threads **dropdown lets you choose to see:

* **Recent Threads:** all threads and proposals with recent activity.

* **Participating threads**: only the threads and proposals which you’ve participated in.

* **Muted: **only the threads which you’ve previously [muted](#heading=h.j9o8kyhomfnj).

## Unread Threads

This page shows all the threads and proposals that have new content since you last visited, sorted by group. You can click **Mark as read **on a thread preview to clear it from this page without actually visiting the thread. You can also **[Mut**e](#heading=h.j9o8kyhomfnj)** **threads here.

## Keeping up to date

### Volume

Volume controls how much you hear from a group or a specific discussion thread.

There are four settings for both group volume and thread volume; **Loud**, **Normal**, **Quiet** and **Mute**.

#### Group volume

You can change your group volume settings by clicking the volume button on your group page and selecting one of the four options:

* **Loud** - this will email you whenever there is activity (comments, votes, new threads, proposals, and proposal outcomes) in the group.

* **Normal** - this will only email you with important activity: new threads or proposals and proposal outcomes. **Normal** is the default for new groups.

* **Quiet** - this switches all emails off. You’ll see new group activity on the **[Unread Thread**s](#heading=h.6w5gow46nqz9) page and the Recent page.

* **Mute** - this switches all emails off. You’ll only be notified if someone @mentions you. This will also remove the group from the **[Unread Thread**s](#heading=h.6w5gow46nqz9) page and the [Yesterday on Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/help#yesterday-on-loomio) digest email.

#### Thread volume

When you start a new thread, it will inherit its default volume from its group. You can change your thread volume settings by clicking the volume button on the thread page and selecting one of the four options:

* **Loud** - this will email you whenever there is activity (comments, votes, proposals, and proposal outcomes) in the group.

* **Normal** - this will only email you with important activity: new proposals and proposal outcomes. **Normal** is the default for new threads.

* **Quiet** - this switches all emails off. You’ll see new thread activity on the **[Unread Thread**s](#heading=h.6w5gow46nqz9) page and **[Recent Thread**s](#heading=h.aobys0nh6em3) page.

* **Mute** - this switches all emails off. You’ll only be notified if someone @mentions you. This will also hide the thread from your dashboard and the [Yesterday on Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/help#yesterday-on-loomio) digest email.

You can mute threads from any thread previews that display on the group page, Recent Threads page and Unread page, by hovering over the thread preview and selecting the **Mute** option. You can also mark threads as read by selecting the **Mark as read** option. This will remove them from your the Unread page.

If you have set a thread to **Loud**, you can reply to any comments you receive directly via email and your replies will be posted in the relevant Loomio thread. You can also choose to view the comment in the context of the thread on Loomio by clicking the **view it on Loomio** link in the footer of the email.

### Email settings

Your **Email settings** page enables you to set default email notification settings for groups and threads. To visit your **Email settings** page, select the **Email settings **option from the user menu in the navigation bar.

### Yesterday on Loomio

The **Yesterday on Loomio** email is a daily summary of content you haven’t read from the previous day. The email contains everything that is not muted. You can turn this on or off from the **[Email setting**s](#heading=h.hq1pg6teo94y) page.

# Frequently asked questions

## Where is my confirmation email?

If you don’t receive an email confirming your group registration, you might need to check your spam or junk mail folder – sometimes they end up in there.

## I’ve forgotten my password, what do I do?

If you’ve forgotten your password click the **"Forgot your password?"** link on the [Log in page](https://www.loomio.org/users/sign_in). You will be asked to enter the email address associated with your Loomio account and password reset instructions will be sent to this email address.

## Do I need a Loomio account to participate in discussions?

Yes. Even though there are different levels of group privacy, everyone who wishes to participate in a Loomio group needs to have a Loomio account.

## Does it cost to use Loomio?

Check out our pricing page at [loomio.org/pricing](https://www.loomio.org/pricing).

## Can I sign in with Google, Facebook or Twitter?

Yes, see [Single sign-on](https://www.loomio.org/help#single-sign-on) in our [help documentation](https://www.loomio.org/help).

## How can I set up my own instance of Loomio?

There is an installation guide on our [Github wiki](https://github.com/loomio/loomio/wiki) and a [Loomio Community sub-group](https://www.loomio.org/g/C7I2YAPN/loomio-community-installing-loomio) dedicated to support and assistance with local installations. If you're thinking about installing your own version of Loomio, we highly recommend joining this group.

## What size groups work well on Loomio?

Loomio currently works well for groups up to about 1000 people.

## I have approved membership requests for people who wanted to join my group but they haven’t shown up as members, what’s going on?

If someone who has requested membership to your group hasn’t already got a Loomio account, they will need to create one before they can join your group. After you approve their membership request, they will receive a confirmation email. Following the link in this email will prompt them to create a Loomio account. When their account has been created they will show up as members of your group.

## How can I stop my signature being included in email replies to threads?

There is currently no official standard for distinguishing email signatures from the rest of the email body. To a computer the whole email is just a block of text. The easiest method we have for marking the end of the email body and the beginning of the signature is the double-dash method popularised by Gmail, which involves inserting a double-dash ('--') on its own line between the body of an email and the signature. Other common formats are recognised too, but Gmail's method is very easy to implement. Most programs trying to separate email body from signature (including Loomio) will correctly ignore email signatures if these dashes are included in the right place.

To be sure that your email signature is not included in your comment when you reply by email, you need to begin your signature with a double hyphen on its own line. For example:

![image alt text](image_1.png)

## Will Loomio work on my mobile device?

Loomio is mobile responsive, so it will work on any device through a browser.

## How can I reactivate my account?

To have your account reactivated, send an email to [contact@loomio.org](mailto:contact@loomio.org).

## I’ve deactivated my group, can I restore it?

Deactivated groups can only be restored by a member of the Loomio team. Send an email to [contact@loomio.org](mailto:contact@loomio.org)

## What if I have a feature to suggest?

We also have an open Loomio Community sub-group dedicated to [Feature Ideas](https://www.loomio.org/g/GN7EFQTK/loomio-community-feature-ideas). You can contribute to discussions about new feature there, or make suggestions about new feature ideas.

## Is there a Loomio API?

We're actively developing and using the API that the new Loomio 1.0 client uses. This implements everything a Loomio client talking to the web service would need. There is currently no server-to-server api, but Loomio is [open source](http://github.com/loomio/loomio) and we welcome contributions.

## Is it possible to have a Loomio subdomain?

Yes. We can, for example, set up **[your-group-name].loomio.org** as the URL for your group. Contact us if you're interested.
