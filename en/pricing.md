# Frequently asked questions

## Our group has no money! Can we still use Loomio?

Yes. You can choose the Gift plan (see our [Pricing](http://loomio.org/pricing) page).

## We haven't decided which plan suits us yet, can we extend the free trial?

Yes. Just email [contact@loomio.org](mailto:contact@loomio.org) and ask.

## How does the Gift plan work?

If your group chooses the Gift plan, your members will see a card like this on their group page:

## Do you have prices for annual subscriptions?

Yes. Our Standard plan costs US$190 for a year (a saving of $38 on the monthly price), and the Plus plan is US$1790 per year (saving $358).

## How does the Slack integration works?

<img class="screenshot" alt="Slack integration" src="slack-integration.png" />

Through the integration with Slack, when important activity happens in your Loomio group (like a new discussion or proposal), it will also show up in a Slack channel of your choice. And people can vote directly from Slack by clicking on the position options. Please note that this integration is only available for paying subscription (Standard or Plus).

## What credit cards do you take?

Visa and Mastercard. Weâ€™re working on American Express.

## Are you GST-registered?

Yes we are. In New Zealand GST is added to the price for all paid subscriptions. GST is not added to donations.

## Can I get invoices?

When you first set up a subscription you will get an email from Chargify, our payment processor, with the subject line **[Loomio] Manage Your Subscription**. That will include a link to log in to your billing portal, which will let you download statements.
