## Inviting new members

<img class="screenshot" alt="Action menu" src="action menu.png" />

Depending on your [group settings](group_settings.html), new members can be invited either by everyone in the group, or by coordinators only. You’ll find the **Invite people** option on the **Members** panel on your group page, and in the **Action Menu **which can be accessed from anywhere in the app.

You can invite multiple people at once by entering their email addresses into the form, separated by commas. When you submit the invitations form an email will be sent to each of the email addresses you supplied, containing a unique invitation link.

Optionally, you can also choose to add a custom message to the invitation, which can be a great way to engage new members. People will want to know why they’ve been invited, what’s expected of them, and why it’s worth their time to learn how to use a new tool.

### Pending invitations

If there is an outstanding invitation that has not yet been accepted, it will be displayed in the Pending Invitations section of the **Members** page, which is accessed via the **Manage Members **link in the **Options **menu on the group page. You can revoke a pending invitation with the cancel button (the circled-X icon).
