## Volume

Volume controls how much you hear from a group or a specific discussion thread.

There are four settings for both group volume and thread volume; **Loud**, **Normal**, **Quiet** and **Mute**.

### Group volume

You can change your group volume settings by clicking the volume button on your group page and selecting one of the four options:

* **Loud** - this will email you whenever there is activity (comments, votes, new threads, proposals, and proposal outcomes) in the group.

* **Normal** - this will only email you with important activity: new threads or proposals and proposal outcomes. **Normal** is the default for new groups.

* **Quiet** - this switches all emails off. You’ll see new group activity on the [**Unread Threads**](reading_loomio.html#unread-threads) page and the Recent page.

* **Mute** - this switches all emails off. You’ll only be notified if someone @mentions you. This will also remove the group from the [**Unread Threads**](reading_loomio.html#unread-threads) page and the [**Yesterday on Loomio**](reading_loomio.html#yesterday-on-loomio) digest email.

### Thread volume

When you start a new thread, it will inherit its default volume from its group. You can change your thread volume settings by clicking the volume button on the thread page and selecting one of the four options:

* **Loud** - this will email you whenever there is activity (comments, votes, proposals, and proposal outcomes) in the group.

* **Normal** - this will only email you with important activity: new proposals and proposal outcomes. **Normal** is the default for new threads.

* **Quiet** - this switches all emails off. You’ll see new thread activity on the [**Unread Threads**](reading_loomio.html#unread-threads) page and [**Recent Threads**](reading_loomio.html#recent-threads) page.

* **Mute** - this switches all emails off. You’ll only be notified if someone @mentions you. This will also hide the thread from your dashboard and the [**Yesterday on Loomio**](reading_loomio.html#yesterday-on-loomio) digest email.

You can mute threads from any thread previews that display on the group page, Recent Threads page and Unread page, by hovering over the thread preview and selecting the **Mute** option. You can also mark threads as read by selecting the **Mark as read** option. This will remove them from your the Unread page.

If you have set a thread to **Loud**, you can reply to any comments you receive directly via email and your replies will be posted in the relevant Loomio thread. You can also choose to view the comment in the context of the thread on Loomio by clicking the **view it on Loomio** link in the footer of the email.

## Email settings

Your **Email settings** page enables you to set default email notification settings for groups and threads. To visit your **Email settings** page, select the **Email settings** option from the user menu in the navigation bar.

## Yesterday on Loomio

The **Yesterday on Loomio** email is a daily summary of content you haven’t read from the previous day. The email contains everything that is not muted. You can turn this on or off from the **Email settings** page.
