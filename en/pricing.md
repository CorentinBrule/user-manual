# Frequently asked questions

## Our group has no money! Can we still use Loomio?

Yes. You can choose the Free plan (see our [Pricing](http://loomio.org/pricing "opens pricing page in new tab") page).

## We haven't decided which plan suits us yet, can you help up?

Yes. Just email [contact@loomio.org](mailto:contact@loomio.org "opens in new tab") and we will help chose the right plan for your needs.

## How does the Free plan work?

If your group chooses the Free plan, your members will be occasionally asked for a voluntary donation.

## Do you have prices for annual subscriptions?

Yes. If you choose an annual subscription you get 2 months free! Our annual Standard plan costs US$190, and the Plus plan is US$990.

## How does the Slack integration works?

<img class="screenshot" alt="Slack integration" src="slack-integration.png" />

Through the integration with Slack, when important activity happens in your Loomio group (like a new discussion or proposal), it will also show up in a Slack channel of your choice. And people can vote directly from Slack by clicking on the position options. Please note that this integration is only available for paying subscription (Standard or Pro).

## What credit cards do you take?

Visa, Mastercard and American Express.

## Are you GST-registered?

Yes we are. In New Zealand GST is added to the price for all paid subscriptions. GST is not added to donations.

## Can I get invoices?

When you first set up a subscription you will get an email from Chargify, our payment processor, with the subject line **[Loomio] Manage Your Subscription**. That will include a link to log in to your billing portal, which will let you download statements.
