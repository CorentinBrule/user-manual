# Keeping up to date

## Email settings

Your email settings control how much you hear from a group or a specific discussion thread. There are three settings for both groups and threads.

### Group email settings

To change your group email setting, open the **Options** dropdown and select **Email settings** from the menu.

* **All activity**: You will be emailed whenever there is activity (comments, votes, new threads, proposals, and proposal outcomes) in this group. **All activity** is the default for new groups. You can read about changing the default email settings for new groups in the **Updating email settings for all groups** section.

* **Important activity**: You will be emailed about new threads and proposals (i.e. when a proposal is started, about to close or when a proposal outcome is created).

* **No emails**: You won't be emailed about activity in this group, but you'll see new group activity on your [**Unread**](reading_loomio.html#unread-threads) and Recent pages.

In order to apply a particular setting to all of your groups, check the **Apply this setting to all my groups** checkbox before submitting the form.


### Thread email settings

When you start a new thread, it will inherit a default email setting from its group. To change your thread email setting, open the thread options dropdown and select **Email settings** from the menu.


* **All activity**: You will be emailed whenever there is activity (comments, new proposals, votes and proposal outcomes) in this thread.

* **Important activity**: You will be emailed when a proposal is started, about to close or when a proposal outcome is created.

* **No emails**: You won't be emailed about this thread.

In order to apply a particular setting to all threads in a group, check the **Apply this setting to all threads in this group** checkbox before submitting the form.

### Updating email settings for all groups

There are three additional email settings that can be applied to all groups.

**Daily summary email**: Enabling this setting means each morning you will get an email with any activity that you missed the day before. This email provides an easy routine for staying up to date with Loomio activity.

**Subscribe on participation**: Enabling this setting means when you participate in a thread, all further activity will be emailed to you immediately.

**Mentions**: Enabling this settings means when someone wants to get your attention they can @mention you and you will be notified via email. We recommend you leave this on, so that you'll get an email when this happens.

These settings can be configured from the user **Email settings** page, which is accessed via the **Email settings** option in the user menu.

### Default settings for new groups

Underneath the **Settings for specific groups** subheading on the user **Email settings** page, you can see your default email setting for new groups. In order to change the default email setting for any new groups you join, click the **Change default** link and select a new default.

### Muting threads

Muting a thread means you won't be notified about proposals, or any other activity taking place in the thread, unless someone @mentions you.

You can mute threads from thread previews that display on the group page, Recent Threads page and Unread page. To mute a thread, hover over the thread preview and select the **Mute** option.

Muted threads are hidden from Recent threads and Unread pages. To find your Muted threads, visit the Recent threads page and select "Muted" from the "Filter threads" menu.

### Marking as read

You can mark threads as read from thread previews that display on the group page, Recent Threads page and Unread page. To mark a thread as read, hover over the thread preview and select the **Mark as read** option. Marking a thread as read will remove it from your [**Unread**](reading_loomio.html#unread-threads) page.

### Replying by email

If you have thread email settings for a particular thread set to **All activity**, you can reply to any comments you receive directly via email and your replies will be posted in the Loomio thread. You can also choose to view the comment in the context of the thread on Loomio by clicking the **view it on www.loomio.org** link in the footer of the email.
