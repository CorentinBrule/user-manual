# Inviting new members

Depending on your [group settings](group_settings.html), new members can be invited either by everyone in the group, or by coordinators only. You’ll find the **Invite people** option on the **Members** panel on your group page, and in the **Action Menu ** which can be accessed from anywhere in the app.

You can invite up to 100 people at once by entering their email addresses separated by commas.

When you submit the invitations an email will be sent to each of the email addresses you supplied, containing a unique invitation link that can only be used once. This email will be sent in your profile language.

You can also add a custom message to the invitation, which is a great way to engage new members. People will want to know why they’ve been invited, what’s expected of them, and why it’s worth their time to learn how to use a new tool.

Alternatively, You can use the Shareable invite link to invite people to join your group. To do so, click on **Shareable link**, copy the link and send it to as many people as you wish.

## Pending invitations

If there is an outstanding invitation that has not yet been accepted, it will be displayed in the Pending Invitations section of the **Members** page, which is accessed via the **Manage Members ** link in the **Options ** menu on the group page. You can revoke a pending invitation with the cancel button (the circled-X icon).
